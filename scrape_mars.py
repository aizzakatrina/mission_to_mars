# Converting your Jupyter notebook into a Python script with a function called scrape.



# Create a route called /scrape that will import your scrape_mars.py script and call your scrape function.
# Store the return value in Mongo as a Python dictionary.
# Create a root route / that will query your Mongo database and pass and display the mars data into an HTML template.

# Use Pymongo for CRUD applications for your database. 
# You can simply overwrite the existing document each time the /scrape url is visited and new data is obtained.
